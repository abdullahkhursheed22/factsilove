From the Big Bang till 380,000 years after it, the universe was opaque with electrons, quarks, and photons. Then, it cooled enough to form protons and neutrons and for the photons to escape. 

During the 14-billion-year age of the universe, this visible light has redshifted in microwaves. So the entire universe is filled with this cosmic microwave background radiation.

The light has cooled down enough to have a temperature of 2.75 K. Thus, the temperature of the universe is 2.75 K.



The red and blue colors correspond to slight variations in the strongest frequency of the waves. CMBR coming from all directions toward Earth is mapped as a sphere. This map is then unrolled to make a flat oval diagram.

Absolute zero is 0
