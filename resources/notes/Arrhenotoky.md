[[Hymenopterans]] make huge sacrifices for their colonies, if even if means sacrificing their own lives. Even though the main objective of living things is their own survival, [[Hymenopterans]] prioritize the survival of the colony using an ability called arrthenotoky.

The objective of all species is to retain as much of their DNA as possible. The primary way to do this is through reproduction, which transfers 50% of the parents' DNA to their immediate offspring.

[[Hymenopterans]] cheat the system through arrthenotoky. It allows the queen to select the gender of her offspring. The queen's children have 50% of her DNA, of course. But her daughters have 75% common DNA with one another. This completely shifts the strategy of survival from reproduction to protecting the queen.

Arrthenotoky allows [[Hymenopterans]] to unlock entirely new sets of abilities, such as eusociality. Eusociality enables them to:

Build huge colonies.

Create war strategies.

Control territories.

Harvest food.

Manage livestock. Several species of ants manage small insects called aphids as their livestock. Aphids feed on the sap from plants and secrete a liquid called honeydew, which is favored by ants as a food source.

Finally, arrthenotoky allows [[Hymenopterans]] to unlock hyperspecializationâ€”overpowered abilities that are only useful in a colony setting:

Honey ants give up their mobility to act as nutrition vessels for the queen and the colony.

Solider ants are big in size and have pincers to protect the colony from enemies.

Trapdoor ants close off entrances to the colony during battles.
