Bees are [[Hymenopterans]].

A single forager bee can search for food as far as 6 kilometers away from its hive. Once it detects a source of food, it returns to the hive and informs the colony by doing a waggle dance.

The precise angle of the dance denotes the direction of the food in comparison to the Sun. Whereas, the duration of the dance denotes its distance from the colony.

Since bees can see ultraviolet and polarized light, they can determine the location of the Sun even during the night.

They also have a mental clock that can calculate the position of the Sun based on the time passed.

Bees create hexagonal shapes in their hive to store the queen's eggs, pollens, and honey. 

The only shapes that can be stacked together without wasting space are triangles, squares, and hexagons. But bees choose the hexagon because it creates the most amount of space with the least amount of material required.

[[Holy Quran (16;68-69)]]

This verse refers to the fact that bees also create their hives in mountains and trees.

All the verbs used in the verse are for the female gender since only female bees forage and make honey. Because bees have multiple stomachs, the word بُطُونِهَا means multiple stomachs of a female bee.
