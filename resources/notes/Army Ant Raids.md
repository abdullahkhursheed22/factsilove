Ants are [[Hymenopterans]].

All species of army ants are nomads. They build temporary homes, go on raids every night, and change the location of their colonies each day.

These temporary homes are called bivouac and are made up of ants holding onto each other. Each bivouac has one queen that it protects.

When army ants go on raids, the entire forest floor takes notice. Everything that crawls and slithers runs, hides, and takes shelter.

During a raid, the front of the swarm is a carpet of ants that can be 60 feet wide. The ants store food they collect in areas of the swarm called booty caches. The swarm takes the shape of a [[Fractal]].

While most creatures take shelter, some take this opportunity the follow the swarm and eat its leftovers. This includes antbirds, butterflies, and parasitic flies. This phenomenon is called kleptoparasitism.

Some species of insects use armor or camouflage to join the ant army.

Although it still poses danger, clown beetles groom the ants to stay alive.

Ant mimics are beetles that groom the ants, mimic their behavior, and even help with the raid.

Rove beetles are able to join the raid because they have a teardrop-shaped skin that is impossible for ants to penetrate.

Some species attach themselves to ant bodies and are impossible for ants to detach.

Ant mites are so tiny that they can attach themselves to ant appendages.

One mite attaches itself to the foot of the ant.

This strategy works because they function like a normal ant foot by attaching themselves to surfaces when required.

Mosquitos can have similar mites on them.
