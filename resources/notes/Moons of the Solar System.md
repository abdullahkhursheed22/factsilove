Here's how many moons each planet in the solar system has:

- Mercury - 0
- Venus - 0
- Earth - 1
- Mars - 2
- [[Jupiter]] - 79 (53 confirmed; 26 provisional)
- [[Saturn]] - 82 (53 confirmed; 29 provisional)
- Uranus - 27
- [[Neptune]] - 14

Below are some of the most interesting moons in the solar system:

[[Saturn]]'s moon Titan is composed of Hâ‚‚O ice glaciers and oceans of ethane and methane. It may also contain liquid water beneath its surface.

[[Jupiter]]'s moon [[Io]] has 400 active volcanoes, making it the most active object in the solar system. It's intense heat comes from the crushing gravitational forces caused by its host planet and neighboring moons. These immense forces can make [[Io]]'s surface bulge up and down by 100 meters.

The surface of [[Saturn]]'s moon Enceladus is covered with ice encompassing a vast ocean of liquid water underneath. It shoots water vapor and ice particle from massive geysers at its south pole, some up to 75 miles long.

*It's fascinating that [[Io]] and Enceladus are polar opposites yet equally hellish.*

[[Saturn]] also contains moons between the gaps in its rings. Its moon Daphnis creates ripples behind it because of its gravitational pull.

Since the orbital speed of the rings if faster, they pass by and lead the moon.
