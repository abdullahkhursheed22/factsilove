All gas giants attract comets and asteroids. Since [[Jupiter]] is the closest to Earth, it has been responsible for protecting humans from life-ending asteroids.

[[Holy Quran (55;5)]]

The largest recorded impact happened in 1994 when the comet [[Shoemakerâ€“Levy 9]] crashed into [[Jupiter]].

The debris of the comet went back into space and kept crashing back into [[Jupiter]], creating this trail.

The comet was 1 km wide and would have probably ended human life if it had crashed into Earth.

[[Holy Quran (22;65)]]
