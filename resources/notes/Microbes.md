Antonie van Leeuwenhoek was a fabric merchant who invented specialized magnifying glasses to inspect the quality of his fabrics. His invention could magnify objects by 270 times.

He was a curious man and used the device to inspect other things. On inspecting a water droplet in 1676, he became the first person to discover microbes.

This is what he wrote about his discovery:

>*...there were many very little living animalcules, very pretilly a-moving.*

The Royal Society of London was opposed to the idea that animals could be small enough to fit inside a drop of water. After attempts of refutation by religious and political leaders, he showcased the experiment to them and proved the existence of microbes.
