The farther you travel away from the Sun, the more distance there is between objects.

[[Jupiter]] is very far away from Earth and the distance to [[Saturn]] is twice that. 

It takes light 5.5 hours to reach us from Pluto.

The 5 planets closest to Earth have been observed in the night sky by humans for millennia.

Uranus was discovered as a planet by William Herschel in 1781 with the aid of a telescope. When he retraced earlier orbits of this "star" in the night sky, they didn't seem to follow Newton's gravitational laws.

Urbain Le Verrier predicted the presence of another planet at a certain location for Uranus' orbit to make sense. When astronomers pointed their telescope at that location in 1846, they discovered [[Neptune]] in one night.

The Kuiper Belt is a ring of icy objects outside the orbit of Neptune. Pluto is a part of the belt, which is why it was demoted from being a planet.

All objects in the Kuiper Belt follow a strict orbital alignment. This phenomenon would make sense if there were a 9th planet 5 times the size of the Earth orbiting the sun way out in the solar system.

While no such planet has been discovered, some scientist argue in favor of its existence. The hypothetical planet is called Planet 9 or Planet X.

*"Essentially when you go far enough away from the Sun, there's enough room to hide almost anything you want."*

The Oort Cloud is a group of icy objects 1 light-year away from the Sun. It extends as far away as 3 light-years. For reference, the closest star to the solar system is 4.2 light-years away.
