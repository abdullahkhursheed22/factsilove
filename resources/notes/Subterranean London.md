The city has been occupied by humans for over two millennia. Over time, the city has acquired a vast number of these structures and spaces, often as a result of war and conflict.

These include abandoned places where the public is not allowed.

Some areas are dozens of stories below the surface and go as far as 67 to 80 meters deep.

There are abandoned sewers, electricity tunnels, war bunkers, underground military bases, and train stations with idle trains.

Most of these train stations were closed after World War II and still possess the infrastructure, counters, and ticket stubs that are decades old.
