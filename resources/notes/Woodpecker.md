The woodpecker's skull consists of a matrix of spongy bones, allowing it to withstand 1200 Gs of force while pecking.

It pecks 20 times a second and can peck 12000 times each day.

Its tongue wraps around its head up to the nostrils to further protect its brain. The long tongue enables it to search for food deep in tree crevices.
