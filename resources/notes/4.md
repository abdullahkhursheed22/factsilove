There are many instances where the number 4 occurs in the solar system.

A complete rotation of Earth takes 23 hours and 56 minutes. This means that the position of a specific star in the night sky would return to its original place in that duration. This is called a sidereal day.

However, the Sun also slightly shifts its position relative to Earth's rotation, adding 4 additional minutes to make up a complete 24-hour day. This is called a solar say.

A solar year consists of 365 and 1/4 days. A leap day is added every 4th year to reconcile the extra time.

The Moon has 4 phases.

Its diameter is 1/400 of the Sun's diameter. It is also 1/400 times closer to Earth than the Sun. This is why they have the same size in the sky and why solar eclipses are possible.

There are 4 terrestrial planets and 4 gas giants in the solar system.
