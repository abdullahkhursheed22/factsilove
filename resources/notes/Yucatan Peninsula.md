Reptiles were once the predominant species on Earth for 165 million years.

This included dinosaurs on land and 17-meter-long mosasaurs in the ocean.

67 million years ago, an 18-kilometer-wide asteroid travelling at 16 kilometers per second hit the Yucatan Peninsula creating a crater that was 30 kilometers deep at its center.

Before the asteroid hit, compressed superheated air around it pulverized the shallow sea of the peninsula.

Upon impact, the explosion was equivalent to 100 million megatons of TNT resulting in a 10.3 magnitude earthquake and a 100-meter-tall tsunami.

The Earth's material that was gouged out flew up to 32 kilometers. Some of it reached escape velocity, overcame Earth's gravity, and started orbiting the Sun. Some of the material may have reached the Moon.

Everything in a 1600-kilometer radius immediately burst into flames.

All trees were debarked and flattened in a 2100-kilometer radius. Storm winds destroyed all trees in a 6500-kilometer radius.

Large ejected pieces of rock fell across the Earth causing wildfires worldwide.

The impact caused high-volume volcanic eruptions on the other side of the planet in an area that is now India.

Ash and debris covered the atmosphere, creating a winter that lasted several thousand years. The absence of sunlight caused plants and the creatures relying on them to die. So 76% of all species went extinct.

The Chicxulub Crater comprises buried circular hills that denote the site of the impact.

Asteroid impacts can be so powerful that they vaporize the asteroid as well as some of the Earth's crust. The same was the case with the dinosaur-killing asteroid.
