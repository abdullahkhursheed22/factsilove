The Kardashev scale is a classification of civilizations' level of technological advancement based on the energy they're able to utilize. Humans are at 0.7 on the Kardashev scale.

Below are the three main classifications of the Kardashev scale:

#### Type I — Planetary
A Type I civilization can utilize all the energy of its home planet and become interplanetary.

This kind of civilization would also possess the ability to mine asteroids.

#### Type II — Stellar
A Type II civilization can utilize all the energy of its home star and become interstellar.

A megastructure encompassing a star to capture its solar power output is called a Dyson sphere.

This kind of civilization could also build a Dyson sphere around a black hole.

#### Type III — Galactic
A Type III civilization can utilize all the energy of its home galaxy and become intergalactic.

The technological advancement of this type of civilization would be far beyond our comprehension.

This type of civilization would be easily able to build colonies and living structures by combining varying interstellar objects.

One such configuration could be comprised of 550 planets, 9 stars, and a black hole at the very center.

The view of this interstellar structure from one of its planets would be surreal.

Some of the other extensions of the Kardashev scale are as follows: 

#### Type 0 — Pre-Planetary
A Type 0 civilization can utilize some of the energy and resources of its home planet.

#### Type IV — Universal
A Type IV civilization can utilize all the energy of its home universe.

#### Type V — Multiversal
A Type V civilization can exist throughout the multiverse.

#### Type VI — Megaversal
A Type VI civilization can exist in an infinite amount of multiverses.

#### Type VII — Omniversal
A Type VII civilization can travel and manipulate all universes, multiverses, and megaverses.

There are also some alternate classifications of civilizations that can manipulate their environment over smaller scales:

#### Type I-minus
A Type I-minus civilization can manipulate objects over their own scale.

#### Type II-minus
A Type II-minus civilization can manipulate genes and the development of living things.

#### Type III-minus
A Type III-minus civilization can create new materials by manipulating molecular bonds.

#### Type IV-minus
A Type IV-minus civilization can manipulate individual atoms.

#### Type V-minus
A Type V-minus civilization can manipulate the nucleas and its nucleons.

#### Type VI-minus
A Type VI-minus civilization can manipulate the most elementary particles, such as quarks and leptons.

#### Type Omega-minus
A Type Omega-minus civilization can manipulate the fabric of space and time itself.
