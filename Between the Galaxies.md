Contrary to common belief, the universe does not consist of galaxies and empty space. There is more matter in intergalactic space than within the galaxies.

These parts of space are occupied by runaway stars, isolated supernovas, X-ray-emitting gas, hydrogen gas clouds, cosmic rays, and vacuum energy.

In galaxy clusters, the mass of gas between the galaxies is 10x more than the mass of objects within the galaxies.

[[Holy Quran (21;16)]]

Besides all matter in and outside galaxies, the universe contains 67% dark energy and 28% dark matter. Ordinary matter only comprises 5% of everything in the universe.

Dark matter is a gravitational force that exceeds all of ordinary matter's gravity by 6x. Without dark matter, normal gravity would not have been enough to pull ordinary matter together and eventually form galaxies.

Like the gravity of galaxy clusters, dark matter also bends light reaching us from distant galaxies. This phenomenon is called gravitational lensing.

Dark energy is a force that acts on and expands empty space in the universe. It continues to increase exponentially as the more the universe expands, the more empty space is there for dark energy to impact.

Because of dark energy, galaxies far away are receding from us faster than the speed of light. Although nothing can move faster than light, this
