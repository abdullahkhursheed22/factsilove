# Facts I Love

"Facts I Love" is a markdown library of interesting facts on astrophysics, nature, and civilization. It includes short texts, pictures, and graphs to deliver a good overview on scientific concepts and acts as a starting point for further research. It is in no way complete and does not claim accuracy.

## Installation

You can just clone the Repo and open it as an Obsidian Vault.
\([Get Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)\)

## Usage

After downloading the Repo and installing Obsidian, you can open Obsidian and in it open the dowloaded Repo as an Obsidian Vault. In the top-level directory, you'll find the Canvas files, which are graphical flowcharts of all the facts and the primary way to view them. You can find files used in these canvases in the resources folder. They are all sorted by file type.

If you want to view the file that is on a Canvas, you can double-left-click the grey title on top of the "bubble". 

\(There might be additional files in the top-level directory that have not been yet relocated to an appropriate subfolder that are note *.canvas files.\)
